# Master's Thesis Project

## Topic Modelling for Metadata Extraction and Generation from Norwegian Parliamentary Texts

In this repository you can find the code used to run the experiments done in my Master's Thesis in 2023 spring.

To setup the project you can install the packages necessary from the requirements.txt

To run the Norwegian-Parliament-Large experiment, you have to download the dataset from here: https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/ressurskatalog/oai-nb-no-sbr-77/
And unzip it, and include the folder Parliamint-NO in the preprocessing folder.

You might have to use the following command to install the correct version of Top2Vec: `pip install git+https://github.com/Lotfi-AL/Top2Vec.git#egg=top2vec`

All the wordclouds generated from the experiments can be found in this repository:
